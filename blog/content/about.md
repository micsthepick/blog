# I'm micsthepick

I like solving puzzles and hard challenges. I also enjoy seeing what I can do with technology and the things around me.

## Nothing is impossible

What do I mean? If it's worthwhile and altruistic then it's worth trying, and giving it your best shot.  
Don't give up. Not even when you are done, just keep trying.

## What I know

I've graduated with distinction in a Batchelor's degree - both Computer science and in Mathematics.  
I can code in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Html/Aspx/Cshtml, C++/C, along with various other languages, but I enjoy learning new things, and am happy to learn new langauges and technologies.

## personal projects
I have completed a few personal projects, including but not limited to:

- [Tetris Cube Solver](https://github.com/micsthepick/TetrisCubeSolver) - my python version of [scott kurowski's tetriscube.exe program.](http://www.scottkurowski.com/tetriscube/), which includes a recursive backtracking solution, and also subtree pruning with a few custom heuristics
- [A morse solver](https://github.com/micsthepick/n-gram-morse-solver) that solves a morse code problem where the characters don't have a seperator between them, but a word seperator is given, using the power of bigrams and statistical analysis.
- [Drum machine pokemon calls](https://github.com/micsthepick/drum-machine-pokemon-calls) - A "drum machine" with pokemon calls, courtesy of Google's AI experiments, that I trained a tsne to organise pokemon by their call, so that similar call sounds group together.
- [DoubleMonoMixer](https://github.com/micsthepick/DoubleMonoMixer) - A reaper JSFX plugin that can be used to mix together two mono sources so that they are audible in both tracks, but still able to be split apart again, using the hilbert transform to do some phase trickery.
- [JSVocalRediso](https://github.com/micsthepick/JSVocalRedIso) - Another JSFX plugin that can be used to split an L, R signal into L, C, R, based on phase and amplitude relationships observed with the FFT. With the right mix of L, R and C, you can remove vocals without losing stereo information, or even isolate vocals, without having L and R bleed through (as much).
- [JSFFTDenoise](https://github.com/micsthepick/JSFFTDenoise), which uses a similar algorithm to remove one noise source from a mix.
- [surroundJSFX](https://github.com/micsthepick/surroundJSFX), using the vocalrediso algorithm to split matrixed sound into discrete channels, and also encoders.
