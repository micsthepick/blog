      <description>You may have been told the truth hurts. Maybe you resonate with this in a very deep and personal way. I&amp;rsquo;m not here to say that the truth is harmless, in fact is it quite the opposite. Jesus in the bible says that his word is a sharp &amp;ldquo;double-edged sword&amp;rdquo;, Whether you believe the bible to be a source of solely truth or even the sole source of absolute truth, the sentiment still stands &amp;ldquo;The truth hurts&amp;rdquo;.</description>
